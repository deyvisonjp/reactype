## React with TypeScript

### Criado com:

`yarn create react-app reactype --template typescript`

### `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
